# 1710-final-project: Role-Based Access Control of a Company

<!-- You should write a one-page README.md file describing how you structured your model and what your model proved. You can assume that anyone reading it will be familiar with your project proposal, but comprehensive documentation is always welcome. Here are some examples of points you might cover:

What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?
What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?
Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?
How should we understand an instance of your model and what your visualization shows (whether custom or default)?

Remember that we welcome collaboration! In that spirit, you should include a list of collaborators at the bottom of your README. If you did not collaborate on the Final Project, you must still indicate this at the bottom of the README. -->

<!-- (how we structured model) -->
Our model represents Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) of a company. We aimed to create traces that, on a somewhat simplified level from a real company, showed how files could transfer in ownership or read/write access over time. Through this, we were aiming to see whether we could expose some sort of vulnerability or possible exploit in a permissions-based structure such as this.

<!-- (explain tradeoffs) -->

<!-- (scope and limits of model) -->
The scope of our model is limited by the sheer number of variables required for even a run with fewer than 10 Employees. We may be able to model smaller companies, perhaps early-stage startups, but not larger companies which could have hundreds of thousands of employees, like Google or Amazon. Our model is also limited to a few different sigs which extend Employee; it would be extremely unrealistic for us to model every type of employee which exists in a real company.
